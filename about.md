Hey there! Welcome to my dev blog. I'm just some guy who dropped out of computer science (got bored) but I still like to program on the side. You'll find some of my favourite projects on here including designing my own compiler, coding a neural network from scratch, and making a live wallpapers hack for Windows

### More Information

My eventual goal is to break into AGI research, but that will likely require finishing my degree. At this stage I'm just coding as a hobby while I decide where to go with my career.
